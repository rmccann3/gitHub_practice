## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
x <- 16
y <- 42
x+y
```

This chuck shows examples for formatting.

For a new paragraph, or a list, note that the blank line before the paragraph/list is **REQUIRED**

- list item 1
- list item 2
  - indented list item

Typing in **bold** and _italics_ 

A numbered list is created by using _any_ numbers

1. list item 1
1. list item 2
4. list item 3
